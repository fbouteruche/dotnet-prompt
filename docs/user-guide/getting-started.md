# Getting Started with dotnet-prompt

Welcome to dotnet-prompt! This guide will help you install the tool and create your first AI-powered workflow in just a few minutes.

## What is dotnet-prompt?

dotnet-prompt is a CLI tool that lets you create and execute AI-powered workflows using simple markdown files. These workflows can analyze your .NET projects, generate code, run tests, create documentation, and automate many development tasks.

## Quick Installation

```bash
# Install as a global .NET tool (once published to NuGet)
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-prompt

# Verify installation
dotnet prompt --version
```

> **Note**: Currently in development. See [Development Installation](#development-installation) for building from source.

## Your First Workflow

Let's create a simple workflow that analyzes a .NET project:

### Step 1: Create a Workflow File

Create a file named `my-first-workflow.prompt.md`:

```yaml
---
name: "my-first-workflow"
model: "gpt-4o"
tools: ["project-analysis", "file-system"]

config:
  temperature: 0.7
  maxOutputTokens: 2000
---

# My First Workflow

Please analyze the current .NET project and provide:

1. **Project Overview**: What type of project is this?
2. **Structure Analysis**: Key files and directories
3. **Dependencies**: Main NuGet packages used
4. **Recommendations**: Any suggestions for improvements

Save the analysis report to `./analysis-report.md`.
```

### Step 2: Run the Workflow

```bash
# Execute the workflow
dotnet prompt run my-first-workflow.prompt.md

# Run with verbose output to see what's happening
dotnet prompt run my-first-workflow.prompt.md --verbose

# Validate the workflow without running it
dotnet prompt run my-first-workflow.prompt.md --dry-run
```

### Step 3: Check the Results

After running successfully, you should see:
- Console output with the analysis
- A new file `analysis-report.md` with detailed results
- Progress file `my-first-workflow.progress.md` for resume capability

## Understanding the Workflow Format

Every dotnet-prompt workflow has two parts:

### 1. YAML Frontmatter (Configuration)
```yaml
---
name: "workflow-identifier"        # Unique name for this workflow
model: "gpt-4o"                   # AI model to use
tools: ["tool1", "tool2"]         # Available tools for this workflow

config:                           # Model-specific settings
  temperature: 0.7                # Creativity level (0.0-1.0)
  maxOutputTokens: 2000           # Response length limit
---
```

### 2. Markdown Content (Instructions)
```markdown
# Workflow Title

Clear instructions for what you want the AI to accomplish.

Use natural language to describe your goals and requirements.
The AI will use the available tools to complete the tasks.
```

## Common Use Cases

### Code Analysis
```yaml
---
name: "code-review"
model: "gpt-4o"
tools: ["project-analysis", "file-system"]
---

# Code Review

Review the code in the current project for:
- Code quality and best practices
- Potential security issues
- Performance improvements
- Documentation gaps
```

### Documentation Generation
```yaml
---
name: "docs-generator"
model: "gpt-4o" 
tools: ["project-analysis", "file-system"]
---

# Documentation Generator

Generate comprehensive documentation including:
- README with setup instructions
- API documentation for public methods
- Code examples and usage patterns
```

### Test Generation
```yaml
---
name: "test-generator"
model: "gpt-4o"
tools: ["project-analysis", "build-test", "file-system"]
---

# Unit Test Generator

Analyze the project and generate unit tests for:
- All public methods in service classes
- Controllers and their actions
- Utility classes and helper methods

Place tests in appropriate test projects with proper naming conventions.
```
