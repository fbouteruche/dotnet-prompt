# Sub-workflow Composition Specification (SK-Orchestrated)

## Overview

This document defines how workflows can compose and invoke sub-workflows using Semantic Kernel's automatic function calling and planning capabilities, including parameter passing, context inheritance, and dependency resolution.

## Status
âœ… **COMPLETE** - SK-based workflow composition patterns defined

## SK-Based Sub-workflow Architecture

### Core Integration Strategy
- **SK Function Calling**: Sub-workflows are exposed as SK functions for automatic orchestration
- **Automatic Planning**: SK automatically determines sub-workflow execution order and dependencies
- **Context Inheritance**: SK ChatHistory and conversation state seamlessly flow between workflows
- **Parameter Mapping**: SK automatic parameter validation and type conversion
- **Error Propagation**: SK filters handle errors across the entire workflow composition

### Sub-workflow as SK Function

#### Workflow Function Registration
```csharp
[KernelFunction("invoke_sub_workflow")]
[Description("Executes a sub-workflow and returns its results")]
public async Task<WorkflowResult> InvokeSubWorkflowAsync(
    [Description("Path to the sub-workflow file")] string workflowPath,
    [Description("Parameters to pass to the sub-workflow")] Dictionary<string, object> parameters,
    [Description("Context inheritance mode: inherit, isolated, or merge")] string contextMode = "inherit",
    KernelArguments? arguments = null,
    CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
{
    // SK automatically handles parameter validation and type conversion
    var subWorkflowContext = await CreateSubWorkflowContext(workflowPath, parameters, contextMode, arguments);
    
    // Execute sub-workflow with SK orchestration
    var subKernel = await _kernelFactory.CreateKernelForSubWorkflowAsync(subWorkflowContext);
    var result = await subKernel.InvokeAsync("execute_workflow", subWorkflowContext.ToKernelArguments());
    
    return new WorkflowResult
    {
        Success = true,
        Result = result.GetValue<string>(),
        Context = subWorkflowContext,
        ExecutionMetadata = ExtractExecutionMetadata(result)
    };
}
```

## Sub-workflow Reference Syntax (SK-Enhanced)

### Automatic Function Calling Workflow Composition
```markdown
I need to analyze this project and generate comprehensive documentation.

First, analyze the project structure and dependencies:
- Use the project analysis workflow to examine the codebase
- Include dependency analysis and test coverage information
- Store the results for subsequent workflows

Then, based on the analysis results, generate multiple documentation types:
- API documentation from the code structure
- README file with project overview and setup instructions  
- Architecture documentation showing component relationships

Finally, validate all generated documentation for consistency and completeness.
```

> **SK Automatic Planning**: With this natural language description and the registered sub-workflow functions, SK will automatically:
> 1. Call `invoke_sub_workflow` for project analysis
> 2. Pass analysis results to documentation generation workflows
> 3. Execute validation workflows with generated documentation
> 4. Handle parameter passing and context inheritance automatically

### Explicit Sub-workflow Invocation (SK Functions)
```markdown
Execute project analysis and documentation generation:

{{sk_function: invoke_sub_workflow
  parameters:
    workflow_path: "./analysis/project-analysis.prompt.md"
    parameters:
      project_path: "{{project_path}}"
      include_tests: true
      analysis_depth: "comprehensive"
    context_mode: "inherit"
}}

Generate API documentation using analysis results:

{{sk_function: invoke_sub_workflow
  parameters:
    workflow_path: "./docs/generate-api-docs.prompt.md" 
    parameters:
      project_metadata: "{{previous_result.metadata}}"
      output_format: "markdown"
      include_examples: true
    context_mode: "merge"
}}
```

### Enhanced Parameter Mapping with SK Validation
```yaml
# Main workflow frontmatter with SK integration
---
sk_configuration:
  execution_settings:
    function_choice_behavior: "auto"
    temperature: 0.7
    max_tokens: 4000
  
parameters:
  - name: "project_path"
    type: "string"
    required: true
    description: "Path to the .NET project file"
    sk_validation:
      pattern: ".*\\.(csproj|fsproj|vbproj)$"
      file_exists: true
  - name: "output_directory" 
    type: "string"
    default: "./docs"
    description: "Directory for generated documentation"
    sk_validation:
      ensure_directory: true
      writable: true

sub_workflows:
  - name: "project_analysis"
    path: "./analysis/project-analysis.prompt.md"
    sk_function_config:
      timeout_seconds: 300
      retry_attempts: 2
      cache_results: true
---

# SK will automatically orchestrate these workflows based on the prompt content
{{sk_function: invoke_sub_workflow
  parameters:
    workflow_path: "{{sub_workflows.project_analysis.path}}"
    parameters:
      input_path: "{{project_path}}"
      output_path: "{{output_directory}}/analysis"
      analysis_options:
        include_dependencies: true
        scan_for_vulnerabilities: false
        generate_metrics: true
    context_mode: "inherit"
}}
```
```

## Context Inheritance

### Inherited Context
- AI provider and model configuration
- Tool availability and registration
- Environment variables and execution context
- Parent workflow variables and state

### Isolated Context
- Independent tool dependencies
- Separate configuration overrides
- Isolated variable scope
- Independent error handling

## Dependency Resolution

### Tool Dependencies
How sub-workflow tool requirements are resolved and merged with parent workflow.

### MCP Server Dependencies
How MCP server requirements are handled across workflow boundaries.

## Sub-workflow Return Values

### Result Propagation
```markdown
{{set: analysis_result = invoke: ./analysis.prompt.md}}

The analysis found {{analysis_result.issues_count}} issues:
{{analysis_result.summary}}
```

### Structured Results
