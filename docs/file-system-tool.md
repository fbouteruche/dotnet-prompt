# File System Tool Specification

## Overview

This document defines the detailed specification for the File System Tool, which provides secure and controlled file system operations for reading, writing, and manipulating files and directories within workflow execution contexts.

## Status
üöß **DRAFT** - Requires detailed specification

## Purpose

The File System Tool provides essential file and directory operations for AI workflows while maintaining security boundaries and preventing unauthorized access to sensitive system areas. It enables workflows to read configuration files, generate code, create documentation, and manage project artifacts.

## Core Functionality

### File Operations
- Read file contents with encoding detection and conversion
- Write file contents with backup and safety mechanisms
- Copy, move, and delete files with confirmation controls
- File metadata extraction (size, dates, permissions)

### Directory Operations
- List directory contents with filtering and recursion
- Create directory structures
- Directory tree navigation and search
- Bulk file operations within directories

### Security and Safety
- Path validation and sandboxing
- Access control and permission checking
- Audit logging for destructive operations
- Backup creation for file modifications

## Output Formats

### File Content Result
```typescript
interface FileContentResult {
    content: string;
    encoding: string;
    sizeBytes: number;
    lineCount: number;
    lastModified: DateTime;
    checksum: string;
}
```

### Directory Listing Result
```typescript
interface DirectoryListingResult {
    path: string;
    items: FileSystemItem[];
    totalFiles: number;
    totalDirectories: number;
    totalSizeBytes: number;
    truncated: boolean;
}

interface FileSystemItem {
    name: string;
    path: string;
    type: "file" | "directory";
    sizeBytes: number;
    created: DateTime;
    modified: DateTime;
    extension?: string;
    isHidden: boolean;
}
```

### File Operation Result
```typescript
interface FileOperationResult {
    success: boolean;
    operation: string;
    path: string;
    sizeBytes?: number;
    backupPath?: string;
    timestamp: DateTime;
}
```

## Security Model

### Path Validation and Sandboxing
- All paths validated against allowed directories
- Parent directory traversal (`../`) restrictions
- Absolute path validation and conversion
- System directory access prevention

### Access Control Policies
```typescript
interface FileSystemSecurityPolicy {
    allowedDirectories: string[];
    blockedDirectories: string[];
    allowedExtensions: string[];
    blockedExtensions: string[];
    maxFileSize: number;
    maxFilesPerOperation: number;
    requireConfirmationForDelete: boolean;
    enableAuditLogging: boolean;
}
```

## Clarifying Questions

## Example Usage Scenarios

### Configuration File Processing
```markdown
Read and process application configuration:

{{invoke_tool: read_file
  file_path: "./appsettings.json"
  encoding: "utf-8"
}}

{{invoke_tool: write_file
  file_path: "./appsettings.Development.json"
  content: "{{updated_config}}"
  create_backup: true
}}
```

### Code Generation
```markdown
Generate new source files:

{{invoke_tool: create_directory
  directory_path: "./Generated/Models"
}}

{{invoke_tool: write_file
  file_path: "./Generated/Models/{{class_name}}.cs"
  content: "{{generated_code}}"
  overwrite: false
}}
```

### Project File Discovery
```markdown
Find all C# source files for analysis:

{{invoke_tool: list_directory
  directory_path: "./src"
  pattern: "*.cs"
  recursive: true
  max_depth: 10
}}
```

## Next Steps

1. Answer the clarifying questions above
2. Define the complete security policy framework
3. Specify error handling and recovery mechanisms
4. Design the file system monitoring capabilities
5. Create performance optimization strategies
6. Implement the Semantic Kernel plugin interface
