## Error Handling Strategies (SK-Implemented)

### SK Filter-Based Error Handling
```csharp
public class WorkflowErrorHandlingFilter : IFunctionInvocationFilter, IPromptRenderFilter
{
    private readonly ILogger<WorkflowErrorHandlingFilter> _logger;
    private readonly IRetryPolicy _retryPolicy;
    
    public async Task OnFunctionInvocationAsync(FunctionInvocationContext context, 
        Func<FunctionInvocationContext, Task> next)
    {
        var stopwatch = Stopwatch.StartNew();
        try
        {
            await _retryPolicy.ExecuteAsync(async () => await next(context));
        }
        catch (SKException ex) when (ex.ErrorCode == SKErrorCodes.FunctionExecutionFailed)
        {
            await HandleToolExecutionError(context, ex);
            throw;
        }
        catch (HttpRequestException ex) when (IsTransientError(ex))
        {
            await HandleTransientNetworkError(context, ex);
            throw;
        }
        finally
        {
            await LogPerformanceMetrics(context.Function.Name, stopwatch.Elapsed);
        }
    }
}
```

### Retry Logic (SK-Integrated)
```yaml
retry_policy:
  # SK-aware retry configuration
  max_attempts: 3
  backoff_strategy: exponential
  base_delay: 1000ms
  max_delay: 30000ms
  retryable_errors:
    - sk_function_timeout
    - ai_service_rate_limit
    - vector_store_connectivity
    - mcp_server_unavailable
    - transient_network_error
```

### Circuit Breaker Pattern (SK Middleware)
Protection against cascading failures in external dependencies.

### Fallback Mechanisms
- Alternative AI providers
- Cached responses
- Graceful degradation

## Logging Levels

### ERROR
- Critical failures that prevent workflow execution
- Unrecoverable errors requiring user intervention
- Security violations

### WARN
- Recoverable errors with fallback mechanisms
- Performance degradation warnings
- Configuration deprecation notices

### INFO
- Workflow execution progress
- Tool invocation results
- Configuration changes

### DEBUG
- Detailed execution traces
- Parameter values and transformations
- Internal state changes

### TRACE
- Low-level diagnostic information
- Performance metrics
- Detailed API communication logs

## User Feedback

### Error Messages
```
Error: Failed to execute workflow 'analysis.prompt.md'
Cause: Project file './MyApp.csproj' not found
Solution: 
  1. Verify the project path is correct
  2. Ensure you're running from the correct directory
  3. Use --project flag to specify the project file

For more details, run with --verbose flag
```

### Progress Indication
- Real-time progress for long-running operations
- Tool execution status
- Sub-workflow progress tracking

### Verbose Output
Detailed execution information when `--verbose` flag is used.
