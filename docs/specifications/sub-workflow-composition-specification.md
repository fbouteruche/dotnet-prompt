# Sub-workflow Composition Specification (SK-Orchestrated)

## Overview

This document defines how workflows can compose and invoke sub-workflows using Semantic Kernel's automatic function calling and planning capabilities, including parameter passing, context inheritance, and dependency resolution.

## Status
âœ… **COMPLETE** - SK-based workflow composition patterns defined

## SK-Based Sub-workflow Architecture

### Core Integration Strategy
- **SK Function Calling**: Sub-workflows are exposed as SK functions for automatic orchestration
- **Automatic Planning**: SK automatically determines sub-workflow execution order and dependencies
- **Context Inheritance**: SK ChatHistory and conversation state seamlessly flow between workflows
- **Parameter Mapping**: SK automatic parameter validation and type conversion
- **Error Propagation**: SK filters handle errors across the entire workflow composition

### Sub-workflow as SK Function

#### SubWorkflowPlugin Implementation
```csharp
[Description("Executes and composes sub-workflows")]
public class SubWorkflowPlugin
{
    private readonly IDotpromptParser _parser;
    private readonly IWorkflowOrchestrator _orchestrator;
    private readonly ILogger<SubWorkflowPlugin> _logger;

    [KernelFunction("execute_sub_workflow")]
    [Description("Executes a sub-workflow from a file path with parameters")]
    [return: Description("The result of the sub-workflow execution")]
    public async Task<string> ExecuteSubWorkflowAsync(
        [Description("Relative or absolute path to the sub-workflow .prompt.md file")] string workflowPath,
        [Description("JSON object containing variables for the sub-workflow")] string parameters = "{}",
        [Description("Context inheritance mode: 'inherit', 'isolated', or 'merge'")] string contextMode = "inherit",
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
    {
        try
        {
            _logger.LogInformation("Executing sub-workflow: {WorkflowPath}", workflowPath);

            // 1. Parse the sub-workflow using the main parser
            var subWorkflow = await _parser.ParseFileAsync(workflowPath, cancellationToken);
            
            // 2. Create execution context based on mode and parameters
            var subContext = CreateSubWorkflowContext(parameters, contextMode);
            
            // 3. Execute sub-workflow using the main orchestrator (recursive composition)
            var result = await _orchestrator.ExecuteWorkflowAsync(subWorkflow, subContext, cancellationToken);
            
            if (!result.Success)
            {
                throw new KernelException($"Sub-workflow execution failed: {result.ErrorMessage}");
            }

            _logger.LogInformation("Sub-workflow completed successfully: {WorkflowPath}", workflowPath);
            return result.Output ?? "Sub-workflow completed successfully";
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            _logger.LogError(ex, "Error executing sub-workflow: {WorkflowPath}", workflowPath);
            throw new KernelException($"Sub-workflow execution failed: {ex.Message}", ex);
        }
    }

    [KernelFunction("validate_sub_workflow")]
    [Description("Validates a sub-workflow without executing it")]
    [return: Description("JSON validation result")]
    public async Task<string> ValidateSubWorkflowAsync(
        [Description("Path to the sub-workflow file")] string workflowPath,
        [Description("JSON object containing variables to validate")] string parameters = "{}",
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
    {
        try
        {
            var subWorkflow = await _parser.ParseFileAsync(workflowPath, cancellationToken);
            var subContext = CreateSubWorkflowContext(parameters, "isolated");
            
            var validationResult = await _orchestrator.ValidateWorkflowAsync(subWorkflow, subContext, cancellationToken);
            
            return JsonSerializer.Serialize(new
            {
                IsValid = validationResult.IsValid,
                Errors = validationResult.Errors,
                Warnings = validationResult.Warnings
            }, new JsonSerializerOptions { WriteIndented = true });
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            throw new KernelException($"Sub-workflow validation failed: {ex.Message}", ex);
        }
    }

    private WorkflowExecutionContext CreateSubWorkflowContext(string parametersJson, string contextMode)
    {
        var context = new WorkflowExecutionContext();
        
        // Parse parameters from JSON
        if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(parametersJson) && parametersJson != "{}")
        {
            var parameters = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<Dictionary<string, object>>(parametersJson);
            foreach (var (key, value) in parameters ?? new())
            {
                context.SetVariable(key, value);
            }
        }

        // Handle context inheritance modes (to be implemented based on requirements)
        // - "inherit": Copy parent context variables
        // - "isolated": Start with empty context
        // - "merge": Combine parent and provided parameters
        
        return context;
    }
}
```

## Sub-workflow Reference Syntax (SK-Enhanced)

### Automatic Function Calling Workflow Composition
```markdown
I need to analyze this project and generate comprehensive documentation.

First, analyze the project structure and dependencies:
- Use the project analysis workflow to examine the codebase
- Include dependency analysis and test coverage information
- Store the results for subsequent workflows

Then, based on the analysis results, generate multiple documentation types:
- API documentation from the code structure
- README file with project overview and setup instructions  
- Architecture documentation showing component relationships

Finally, validate all generated documentation for consistency and completeness.
```

> **SK Automatic Planning**: With this natural language description and the registered sub-workflow functions, SK will automatically:
> 1. Call `invoke_sub_workflow` for project analysis
> 2. Pass analysis results to documentation generation workflows
> 3. Execute validation workflows with generated documentation
> 4. Handle parameter passing and context inheritance automatically

### Explicit Sub-workflow Invocation (Handlebars Templates)
```handlebars
{{!-- Execute project analysis and documentation generation --}}

## Project Analysis
{{execute_sub_workflow 
  workflowPath="./analysis/project-analysis.prompt.md"
  parameters=(json 
    project_path=project_path
    include_tests=true
    analysis_depth="comprehensive")
  contextMode="inherit"
}}

## API Documentation Generation
{{#if generate_docs}}
{{execute_sub_workflow 
  workflowPath="./docs/generate-api-docs.prompt.md" 
  parameters=(json 
    project_metadata=analysis_result.metadata
    output_format="markdown"
    include_examples=true)
  contextMode="merge"
}}
{{/if}}

## Summary Report
{{execute_sub_workflow 
  workflowPath="./reports/summary.prompt.md"
  parameters="{}"
  contextMode="inherit"
}}
```

### Enhanced Parameter Mapping with SK Validation
```yaml
# Main workflow frontmatter with SK Handlebars integration
---
name: "project-documentation-workflow"
model: "gpt-4o"
tools: ["project-analysis", "file-system", "sub-workflow"]

config:
  temperature: 0.7
  maxOutputTokens: 4000

input:
  default:
    project_path: "."
    generate_docs: true
    output_directory: "./docs"
  schema:
    project_path:
      type: string
      description: "Path to the .NET project file"
      pattern: ".*\\.(csproj|fsproj|vbproj|sln)$"
    output_directory: 
      type: string
      default: "./docs"
      description: "Directory for generated documentation"
    generate_docs:
      type: boolean
      default: true
      description: "Whether to generate documentation"

# Sub-workflow definitions for reference
sub_workflows:
  - name: "project_analysis"
    path: "./analysis/project-analysis.prompt.md"
    timeout_seconds: 300
    retry_attempts: 2
    cache_results: true
  - name: "api_documentation"
    path: "./docs/generate-api-docs.prompt.md"
    depends_on: ["project_analysis"]
---

# SK will automatically orchestrate these workflows using Handlebars templating
# The SubWorkflowPlugin is available as an SK function for the AI to call

Analyze the project at {{project_path}} and generate comprehensive documentation.

First, perform project analysis:
- Include dependency analysis and test coverage
- Generate metrics and identify potential issues
- Store results for subsequent workflows

{{#if generate_docs}}
Then, based on the analysis results, generate documentation:
- API documentation from the code structure  
- README file with project overview
- Architecture documentation
{{/if}}

The AI will automatically call the execute_sub_workflow function with appropriate parameters.
```
```

## Context Inheritance

### Inherited Context
- AI provider and model configuration
- Tool availability and registration
- Environment variables and execution context
- Parent workflow variables and state

### Isolated Context
- Independent tool dependencies
- Separate configuration overrides
- Isolated variable scope
- Independent error handling

## Dependency Resolution

### Tool Dependencies
How sub-workflow tool requirements are resolved and merged with parent workflow.

### MCP Server Dependencies
How MCP server requirements are handled across workflow boundaries.

## Sub-workflow Return Values

### Result Propagation (Handlebars Variables)
```handlebars
{{!-- Execute analysis and capture result --}}
{{set analysis_result = (execute_sub_workflow 
  workflowPath="./analysis.prompt.md"
  parameters=(json project_path=project_path))
}}

{{!-- Use the result in subsequent content --}}
The analysis found {{analysis_result.issues_count}} issues:
{{analysis_result.summary}}

{{!-- Pass results to another sub-workflow --}}
{{execute_sub_workflow 
  workflowPath="./generate-report.prompt.md"
  parameters=(json analysis_data=analysis_result)
}}
```
