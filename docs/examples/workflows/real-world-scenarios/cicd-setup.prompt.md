# CI/CD Pipeline Setup Workflow

Create a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline tailored for the .NET project with modern DevOps practices.

## Pipeline Configuration
- **CI/CD Provider**: {{ci_provider}}
- **Deployment Targets**: {{#each deployment_targets}}{{this}}{{#unless @last}}, {{/unless}}{{/each}}
- **Security Scanning**: {{#if enable_security_scanning}}Enabled{{else}}Disabled{{/if}}
- **Performance Testing**: {{#if include_performance_tests}}Enabled{{else}}Disabled{{/if}}

## Pipeline Design Process

### 1. Project Analysis for Pipeline Requirements
- Analyze project type and deployment needs
- Identify testing requirements and strategies
- Review current build process and dependencies
- Assess security and compliance requirements

### 2. Environment and Infrastructure Planning
- Define deployment environments (dev, staging, production)
- Plan resource requirements and scaling needs
- Design environment-specific configurations
- Establish security and access controls

## CI/CD Pipeline Components

### Build Stage
```yaml
# Build pipeline configuration will include:
- Code checkout and workspace setup
- .NET SDK installation and version management
- Dependency restoration and caching
- Multi-configuration builds (Debug/Release)
- Build artifact generation and packaging
- Build quality gates and failure handling
```

### Test Stage
```yaml
# Testing pipeline will include:
- Unit test execution with parallel processing
- Integration test execution
- Test result reporting and analysis
- Code coverage collection and reporting
- Test artifact preservation
{{#if include_performance_tests}}
- Performance test execution and benchmarking
- Performance regression detection
{{/if}}
```

{{#if enable_security_scanning}}
### Security Stage
```yaml
# Security pipeline will include:
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Container security scanning (if using containers)
- Security compliance checks
- Security report generation and alerting
```
{{/if}}

### Quality Gates
```yaml
# Quality gates will enforce:
- Minimum test coverage thresholds (80%+)
- Build success requirements
- Security scan approval
- Code quality metrics compliance
- Performance baseline maintenance
```

## Deployment Strategy

{{#contains deployment_targets "docker"}}
### Docker Deployment
- **Containerization**: Create optimized Docker images
- **Multi-stage builds**: Minimize image size and security surface
- **Registry management**: Push to container registry with tagging strategy
- **Security scanning**: Scan container images for vulnerabilities
- **Configuration management**: Environment-specific container configs
{{/contains}}

{{#contains deployment_targets "azure"}}
### Azure Deployment
- **Azure App Service**: Web application deployment configuration
- **Azure Container Instances**: Containerized deployment setup
- **Azure DevOps integration**: Service connections and permissions
- **Infrastructure as Code**: ARM templates or Terraform configurations
- **Monitoring setup**: Application Insights and logging configuration
{{/contains}}

{{#contains deployment_targets "aws"}}
### AWS Deployment
- **Elastic Beanstalk**: Application deployment configuration
- **ECS/Fargate**: Container orchestration setup
- **Lambda**: Serverless deployment (if applicable)
- **CloudFormation**: Infrastructure as Code templates
- **CloudWatch**: Monitoring and logging setup
{{/contains}}

{{#contains deployment_targets "kubernetes"}}
### Kubernetes Deployment
- **Deployment manifests**: Kubernetes YAML configurations
- **Service definitions**: Load balancing and networking
- **ConfigMaps and Secrets**: Configuration management
- **Ingress configuration**: External access and routing
- **Helm charts**: Package management and templating
{{/contains}}

### Environment Management
- **Development**: Automatic deployment on feature branch merges
- **Staging**: Manual approval with automated testing
- **Production**: Gated deployment with rollback capabilities
