- Component relationship mapping

### ðŸ“¦ `dependency-analysis.json`
- Structured dependency data
- Update recommendations
- Security findings

{{#if include_security}}
### ðŸ”’ `security-assessment.md`
- Security findings and recommendations
- Vulnerability details and remediation steps
- Security best practices compliance
{{/if}}

### ðŸ“Š `quality-metrics.json`
- Code quality measurements
- Complexity metrics
- Coverage analysis

### ðŸ’¡ `improvement-recommendations.md`
- Prioritized improvement suggestions
- Technical debt remediation plan
- Quick wins and long-term improvements

## Analysis Standards

Ensure all analysis:
- âœ… Is objective and data-driven
- âœ… Provides actionable recommendations
- âœ… Includes specific examples and evidence
- âœ… Prioritizes findings by impact and effort
- âœ… Maintains compatibility with existing functionality

This analysis phase provides the foundation for all subsequent improvement phases.
