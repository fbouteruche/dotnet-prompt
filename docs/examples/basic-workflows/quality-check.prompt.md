# Quick Quality Check

Perform a rapid quality assessment of the .NET project to identify immediate issues and improvements.

## Quality Assessment Areas

### 1. Build Health
- Attempt to build the project
- Identify any build errors or warnings
- Check if the project builds successfully in Release configuration

### 2. Project Structure Quality
- Evaluate project organization and file structure
- Check for proper separation of concerns
- Identify any obvious architectural issues

### 3. Code Quality Indicators
- Review naming conventions and coding standards adherence
- Look for potential code smells or anti-patterns
- Check for proper error handling patterns

### 4. Configuration Review
- Examine configuration files for best practices
- Check for hardcoded values that should be configurable
- Verify security considerations in configuration

### 5. Test Presence
- Check if unit tests exist and are properly organized
- If tests exist, run them to verify they pass
- Assess test coverage if information is available

## Report Generation

Create a quality report called `quality-check-report.md` with:

### ‚úÖ Strengths Found
