# Comprehensive Code Review Workflow

Perform a thorough code review focusing on quality, security, and maintainability.

## Review Configuration
- **Scope**: {{review_scope}}
- **Focus Areas**: {{#each focus_areas}}{{this}}{{#unless @last}}, {{/unless}}{{/each}}
- **Generate Fixes**: {{#if generate_fixes}}Yes{{else}}No{{/if}}

## Code Review Process

### 1. Pre-Review Analysis
- Build the project to ensure it compiles
- Run existing tests to establish baseline
- Analyze project structure and organization
- Identify key areas for focused review

{{#eq review_scope "full"}}
### 2. Comprehensive Code Analysis
- Review all source files for quality and standards compliance
- Analyze architecture and design patterns
- Check for consistent coding conventions
- Evaluate error handling and logging practices
{{/eq}}

{{#eq review_scope "recent-changes"}}
### 2. Recent Changes Analysis
- Focus on files modified in the last 30 days
- Review new features and bug fixes
- Analyze impact of recent changes on overall codebase
- Check for proper testing of new functionality
{{/eq}}

{{#eq review_scope "specific-area"}}
### 2. Targeted Area Analysis
- Focus on specific components or modules
- Deep dive into critical business logic
- Analyze complex algorithms and data processing
- Review integration points and external dependencies
{{/eq}}
