# Build & Test Tool Specification

## Overview

This document defines the detailed specification for the Build & Test Tool, which executes .NET CLI build, test, and publish operations with comprehensive output capture and structured result analysis.

## Status
üöß **DRAFT** - Requires detailed specification

## Purpose

The Build & Test Tool provides standardized execution of .NET CLI operations (build, test, publish) with rich output parsing and structured results that can be consumed by AI workflows for decision-making about code quality, deployment readiness, and test coverage.

## Core Functionality

### Build Operations
- Execute `dotnet build` with configurable parameters
- Parse and structure build output and errors
- Extract build metrics and performance data
- Support for multiple configurations and target frameworks

### Test Operations
- Execute `dotnet test` with filtering and configuration options
- Parse test results from multiple test frameworks
- Collect code coverage data
- Generate structured test reports

### Publish Operations
- Execute `dotnet publish` for deployment preparation
- Support for various deployment models (self-contained, framework-dependent, single-file)
- Generate deployment artifacts and metadata
- Calculate deployment size and optimization metrics

## Output Formats

### Build Result Structure
```typescript
interface BuildResult {
    success: boolean;
    duration: TimeSpan;
    configuration: string;
    targetFramework?: string;
    outputPath?: string;
    warnings: BuildMessage[];
    errors: BuildMessage[];
    metrics: BuildMetrics;
    artifacts: string[];
}
```

### Test Result Structure
```typescript
interface TestResult {
    success: boolean;
    duration: TimeSpan;
    summary: TestSummary;
    testCases: TestCaseResult[];
    coverage?: CoverageData;
    resultsFile?: string;
    assemblies: TestAssembly[];
}
```

### Publish Result Structure
```typescript
interface PublishResult {
    success: boolean;
    duration: TimeSpan;
    outputPath: string;
    sizeBytes: number;
    deploymentType: string;
    artifacts: string[];
    metrics: PublishMetrics;
}
```

## Clarifying Questions

### 1. Build Configuration Support
- Should the tool support custom MSBuild configurations beyond Debug/Release?
- How should multi-targeting builds be handled (build all targets vs specific target)?
- Should there be support for platform-specific builds (x64, ARM, etc.)?
- How should custom MSBuild properties be passed and validated?

### 2. Build Output Parsing
- What level of detail should be extracted from MSBuild output?
- How should build warnings and errors be categorized and prioritized?
- Should the tool extract performance metrics (compile time, memory usage)?
- How should incremental build detection work?

### 3. Test Framework Support
- Which test frameworks should be explicitly supported (xUnit, NUnit, MSTest)?
- How should test result parsing work across different frameworks?
- Should there be support for custom test adapters?
- How should parallel test execution be configured and monitored?

### 4. Test Filtering and Selection
- What test filtering capabilities should be provided (name, category, trait)?
- Should there be support for test playlists or test sets?
- How should flaky test detection and handling work?
- Should there be support for test prioritization?

### 5. Code Coverage Integration
- Which code coverage tools should be supported?
- What coverage metrics should be extracted (line, branch, method)?
- How should coverage reports be generated and formatted?
- Should there be coverage threshold checking?

### 6. Publish and Deployment
- Which deployment models should be supported?
- How should the tool handle different target runtimes?
- Should there be container publishing support?
- How should deployment size optimization be measured and reported?

### 7. Performance and Timeout Handling
- What timeout policies should be applied to build/test/publish operations?
- How should long-running operations be monitored and reported?
- Should there be support for operation cancellation?
- How should resource usage be monitored during operations?

### 8. Error Handling and Recovery
- How should different types of build/test failures be categorized?
- What retry logic should be implemented for transient failures?
- How should partial failures be handled (some tests pass, others fail)?
- Should there be automatic error diagnosis and suggestions?

### 9. Integration with CI/CD
- How should the tool integrate with existing CI/CD pipelines?
- What artifacts should be preserved for downstream consumption?
- How should build/test results be formatted for CI/CD systems?
- Should there be support for build artifact caching?

## Example Usage Scenarios

### Basic Build and Test
```markdown
Build the project and run all tests:

{{invoke_tool: build_project
  project_path: "./MyApp.csproj"
  configuration: "Release"
}}

{{if build_success}}
{{invoke_tool: test_project
  project_path: "./MyApp.Tests.csproj"
  collect_coverage: true
}}
{{endif}}
```

### Filtered Testing
```markdown
Run only unit tests with coverage:

{{invoke_tool: test_project
  project_path: "./MySolution.sln"
  filter: "Category=Unit"
  collect_coverage: true
  timeout_minutes: 15
}}
```

### Production Deployment
```markdown
Build and publish for production:

{{invoke_tool: publish_project
  project_path: "./MyApp.csproj"
  runtime: "linux-x64"
  configuration: "Release"
  self_contained: true
  single_file: true
}}
```

## Next Steps

1. Answer the clarifying questions above
2. Define the complete output data structures
3. Specify MSBuild output parsing logic
4. Design test result aggregation and reporting
5. Create error handling and retry mechanisms
6. Implement the Semantic Kernel plugin interface
